# NoisyABSA: Domain Generalization on ABSA task via utilizing noisy student architecture

## Intoduction
This repository contains the implementation of NoisyABSA, which achieved high domain generalization performance in ABSA tasks. We applied the Noisy Student architecture in the NLP task, specifically Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis. With this approach, our model NoisyABSA surpasses the existing SOTA model and achieves new SOTA in the cross-domain tasks of ABSA.
